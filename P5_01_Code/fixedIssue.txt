new stuff
    - new way to moderat warning and banishment
        -> warning and banishment have their own table in bdd
        -> one entry by warn or ban, set as inactive(instead of delete) when user is unwarn / unban (allow to keep logs)
        -> model WarningManager to manage warn / ban entries
    - moderat website view
        -> suppose to be for manage unused images, unused tags, contract reminder (mail before contract end) and warn/ban. 
            But unused tags and images are frequently deleted, so for now this will be usefull only for contract reminder and warn / ban managing
        -> later i'll use a 'cron', which execute some code automaticaly at precise date or every X day/month etc
    - add warning view
        -> because of the new way to moderat warning ans banishment, there is now a view to add a warning, with a text. 
        -> banishment come itself after 3 active warning
        -> unbanishment can happen itself if a banished user connect on the website and if dateToday >= date of unbanishment
        -> remove dateBan from user table (information is now on warn/ban table).we keep 'nbWarning' and 'isBan' field on user table cause its usefull
    - new way to moderat contract
        -> have their own table (user contract / school contract)
        -> each entries are a remind. remind one month before contract end, one week, and the last remind tell that the contract is over
    - settings view
        -> to see account/contract information
        -> also some option
        
fixed issues
    - moderatUser / moderatAdmin :
        -> URL to edit grade is now OK (was a Js error)
        -> also, inactive users were not display because i was comparing int with string 
            (look like models are not hydrated when we use fetchObject.. so their attributs are only of type string for most of them)
            but its fixed 
    - warn/ban
        -> replace every use of user->dateBan
    - contract
        -> add field mail for school, to remind theme when contract is near to end
        -> replace every "User/School->dateDeadline" and delete field 'dateDeadline' for both user and school models
            replace by $contractManager entries
        -> webmaster can activate and disable school
