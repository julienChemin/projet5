fixed issues
    - backend schoolProfileView -> view depend if user is admin or moderator ( allow me to delete all the condition 'if grade=admin') that more readable
    - spliting some view into admin / webmaster side (more readable)
        -> moderatSchoolView
        -> moderatAdminView
        -> moderatUsersView
        -> schoolHistory
        -> schoolProfileView
