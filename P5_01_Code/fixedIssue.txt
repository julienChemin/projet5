new stuff
    - add some informations in signIn / signUp view to explain the use of first/last firstName
    - add option edit pseudo, first / last name, mail on user settings
    - backside : moderatUser -> user are sorted by name

fixed issues
    - refacto table as_comment / as_report(comment - post - other) / as_remind(school - user)
    - editing php - way to display comment
    - before, when you get a Post you get the comments too (query inner join). 
        Now you get the post alone, and you need to get the comments manually 
        (allow me to make jointure under comments and user and avoid to get multiple useless entries)
    - action on user / moderator / admin in admin side have to be update to work with the last / first name feature
    - css fixe on sign up view
    - school name don't appear anymore for user with no school (either profile and publication)
    - lil fix for edit profile text (first/last name / school name) for no school user
